HOMEWORK#12
SCHOOL INVENTORY

1.	For this task, write a few paragraphs describing a project that would benefit greatly from an OOP structure. (This could be any kind of application, running on any type of system)
Because OOP is one way to organized and make the application easy to maintain it can be applied to a SCHOOL PROPERTIES INVENTORY.  This will include different users, teacher, admin, school owner and a tool keeper.  School properties are distributed to different department such as grade levels, laboratories, offices etc.  Record must be encoded every time purchase is made. This will then assign to the department which the items is intended to use. The condition of every item is being monitored and in case the item is destroyed it will be reported and reflected to the inventory.  Before the reported destroyed item encoded to the inventory application it should be checked and approved by person in charge of the inventory and approved by the owner or president.

2.	 What is the application's purpose
This application will run online so whenever there will be a request of any item the admin can be notified the request will be evaluated.  
This application will help keep track all the properties owned by the school hence extra expenses can be controlled and too much expenses by acquiring school properties like office furniture, computer etc.  Keeping the condition of all items is also easy to check and accountability is also addressed properly.


3.	How would people use it
The application can be access from any devices that can be connected to internet.  This will include login system.  
Every time the school acquires new item it will be recorded to the system.  A specific item can be assign to any department and to a person who is charged or responsible for the item.  A person who is assigned to take care for an item can check all items that is assigned to them.  Should there be any problem the item it should be reported and marked as “BAD” if broken and “GOOD” if the item is in good condition.
A user can use the application to request for specific item to the admin and if approve it will be mark approved and deliver the item, if not the request will be mark cancelled.
Request for repair can be also included in the inventory.  Record must include the date of request and date of accomplishment.
4.	 What information would they enter
Information to be entered can be the following.
a.	Name of users
b.	Type of user
c.	Name of items
d.	Number of items
e.	Condition of items
f.	Purchase request form
g.	Request repair form
h.	Mark item as bad / broken
i.	Mark item as good / good condition
j.	Approve request
k.	Canceled request
l.	Accident report if somebody damage the item

5.	and what would be received

The user being assigned to take care of the item will know the conditions of all stems as well as the number of items available in his or her responsibility.  They will know if there request is approved.  The user as the ability to create a report if something happen to the item.

The admin can monitor the condition of all items, the number of items and the availability of the items.  Can read the report of the users.  He can remove items if necessary can add number of item if necessary. Can add user, remove user.


6.	Try to mention all the "stories" in which the user performs any kind of CRUD operation.

A regular user can create report, request, update profile and delete request or report
An admin can create user, add item, remove item, and update inventory data.  Can delete users, items, report and request.
The owner approve disapproved request, read request, and delete user, can delete items.







7.	Next, using pseudocode (or any other notation-technique or diagramming tool you wish), map out what the main objects of the system would look like

The diagram has been submitted as zip file in pirple site.

8.	how they would be constructed

This will be constructed using HTML5, CSS3, and JAVASCRIPT with NODE.JS and MONGODB as a backend.

9.	and how they would relate to each other. 

HTML, CSS3 and JAVASCRIPT will handle the frontend part of the project.  This is the part the user can use and interact with. NODE.JS and MONGODB will handle the files or data in the application.
